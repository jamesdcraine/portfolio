            <p>
               Just an ol' country boy from Norcross, GA looking to make the yankee dollar at a higher rate for some work
 using his brain. I'm into a lot of things but the main ones are my family, football (and more importantly, fantasy football), mushrooms and the greatest rock band of all time, Ween. </p>
    <p>I used to be a great writer, maybe one of the greatest of my generation but the Internet has made me stupid and given me an attention span of 35 seconds. Now I wander the woods looking for rare fungi in an attempt to reconnect with the very nature that once had me mauled by a grizzly bear and bull turkey on the same occasion (I could have fought off the bull turkey had I not been previously incapacitated by the grizzly... the turkey was certainly the lesser of the maulings but it was recorded on video and won the million dollar prize on the 1993 edition of America's Funniest Home Videos which was humiliating). I got to meet both Bob Saget and Dave Coulier, however, Bob as host as AFHV and Dave as they were trying to launch America's Funniest People at the time as well. Met him backstage, he told me to "Cut. It. Out!" and oh how I LOL'd. I LOL'd so hard the grizzly attack scar on my belly throbbed.</p>
