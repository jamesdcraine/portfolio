            <p>Hi, I'm James, a full stack developer from Atlanta, Georgia. I'm married to the love of my life with no kids and a dog on the way. My hobbies include hiking, nature photography, cooking and fantasy football. I've been in a 'keeper' fantasy football league with the same friends for 15 years and have never once won the title (i've lost in the finals 3 times) and, maybe as a result, it takes up an inordinately large amount of my mental real estate (but is also my very favorite thing). My keepers for next year are Michael Thomas in the 3rd round and Darren Waller in the 16th. 2020 is my year.</p>

            <p>In my life i've had cancer, played poker on tv, helped the police apprehend a serial killer and discovered a new species of mushroom. Now I can add to the list that I learned web development at 41 years old. My journey into web development started as a self guided endeavor but now I attended Georgia Tech's Full Stack Developer Bootcamp with hopes to graduate mid-May and then find employment using my newly learned skills sometime thereafter. I'm an insatiable learner and that's (hopefully!) something that will never change about me.</p>
