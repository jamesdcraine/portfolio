            <p>Hi, I'm James, a full stack developer from Atlanta, Georgia. I'm married to the love of my life and we have a puppy named Izzy. My hobbies include hiking, nature photography, cooking and fantasy football. I've been in a 'keeper' fantasy football league with the same friends for 15 years and have never once won the title (i've lost in the finals 3 times) and, maybe as a result, it takes up an inordinately large amount of my mental real estate (but is also my very favorite thing). My keepers for this year, assuming it happens, are Michael Thomas in the 3rd round and Miles Sanders in the 6th round. 2020 is my year.</p>

            <p>In my life i've had cancer, played poker on tv, helped the police apprehend a serial killer and discovered a new species of mushroom. Now I can add to the list that I learned web development at 41 years old. My journey into web development started as a self guided endeavor but in May I graduated from Georgia Tech's Full Stack Developer Bootcamp and I recently completed both Fundamentals of Graphic Design and UI/UX Design Specialization at California Institute of the Arts. I'm an insatiable learner and that's something that will never change about me.</p>
